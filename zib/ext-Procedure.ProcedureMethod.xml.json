  "description": "An extension to provide the method or technique that was used to perform the procedure, e.g. approach, lavage, pressuring, etc.",
  "purpose": "This extension represents the ProcedureMethod concept of the Dutch [zib ('Zorginformatiebouwsteen', i.e. Health and Care Information Model) Procedure v5.2 (2020)](https://zibs.nl/wiki/Procedure-v5.2(2020EN)). The FHIR procedure method extension (http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/procedure-method) cannot be used in R4 because it has a `0..1` cardinality which does not match the zib cardinality of `0..*` for this concept. The next release of FHIR, R5, will fix the cardinality to `0..*` (https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-30769) allowing the replacement of this extension with the HL7 FHIR core extension.",
