These can be visits, appointments or non face-to-face interactions.\r\n\r\nContacts can be visits to the general practitioner or other practices, home visits, admissions (in hospitals, nursing homes or care homes, psychiatric institutions or convalescent homes) or other relevant contacts. This includes past and future contacts.",
