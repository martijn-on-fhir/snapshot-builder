The Location profile acts as the focal resource of the HealthcareProvider because most references to this zib are concerned about the recording of the physical location where the care to patient/client takes place rather than the organizational information. Often there's no clear distinction between an organizational structure and a physical location. As a rule of thumb, locations are always used for recording where a service occurs, and hence where encounters and observations take place.\r\n\r\nHealthcare providers usually consist of multiple organizational levels and physical locations. The hierarchical structure may be captured by using multiple instances of this profile, using the `Organization.partOf` element to refer to their parent organization. The physical location is captured using the zib-HealthcareProvider profile, which refers this profile at the appropriate level in the hierarchy.",
