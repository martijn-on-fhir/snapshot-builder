Core outcomes are identified for 41 specialties, linkages with NANDA diagnoses and with Gordon's functional health patterns have been updated, and the outcomes are organized in both the NOC taxonomy and the Taxonomy of Nursing Practice. This edition of NOC also reports the research results form 10 clinical testing sites.",
