  "description": "An extension to provide a (written) statement in which a person indicates wishes concerning future medical action, in the event that this person is at that point no longer (deemed) capable of taking decisions on the matter.",
  "purpose": "This extension represents the AdvanceDirective concept of the Dutch [zib ('Zorginformatiebouwsteen', i.e. Health and Care Information Model) TreatmentDirective2 v1.0 (2020)](https://zibs.nl/wiki/TreatmentDirective2-v1.0(2020EN)). The cardinality of the `Consent.source[x]` element does not comply with the cardinality of the AdvanceDirective concept (NL-CM:2.2.8). This is solved by adding an extension that can be used to provide additional sources after the `Concent.source[x]` is populated first.",
