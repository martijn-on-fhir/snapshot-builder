  "description": "Pregnancy or gravidity is the condition in which a woman carries a fertilized egg, which grows into an embryo and then a fetus. A pregnancy of between 37 and 42 weeks is considered normal. “Term pregnancy” is 37 to 42 weeks. The term gravidity is also used for the number of times a woman has been pregnant. This and parity - the number of times a woman has given birth - provides insight into the patient’s obstetric history.",
