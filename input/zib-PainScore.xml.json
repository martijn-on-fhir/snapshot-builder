  "description": "The pain score is a general measurement for pain experience, not a description of specific, localized pain.\r\n\r\nThe following are used as an easily reproducible measurement for pain experience:\r\nNRS (Numeric Rating Scale) in which the patient gives the pain a number on a scale of 1 (no pain) to 10 (unbearable pain).\r\nVAS (Visual Analogue Score), in which the patient points to a bar with a line to indicate the pain they feel. The back of the bar has a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (unbearable pain) on it.\r\n\r\nThe results of both scores have the same meaning, but the visual analogue method (VAS) is seen as more reliable than the NRS pain score.",
