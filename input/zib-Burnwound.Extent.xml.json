        "definition": "The extent of a burn wound is indicated in a percentage of the ‘Total Body Surface Area’ (TBSA). For adults, the TBSA can be calculated on the basis of the ‘rule of nines’, in which body parts are expressed in the percentage 9 and multiples of 9. This ‘rule of nines’ cannot be used for children because a child’s body proportions are different from those of an adult. For children, separate tables were developed per age group to determine the extent of burn wounds. Another option is measuring the extent using the patient’s hand surface area. The surface area of a patient’s hand (including the fingers) equals approximately 1% of their total body surface area.\r\n(Source: Brandwonden genezen. Hoe verder? [Healing Burn Wounds. What now?)",
