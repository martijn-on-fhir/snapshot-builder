  "description": "The prescribed substance is usually medication. However, medical aids and bandages can also be prescribed and supplied via the pharmacy. Food and blood products do not strictly belong in the medication category, but can be prescribed and supplied by a pharmacy as well.\r\n\r\nA type of medication can be indicated with **a single code**. That code can be chosen from several possible coding systems (concretely: GPK, PRK, HPK or article numbers). Correct use of these codes in the software systems will sufficiently record the composition of the product used, making a complete product specification unnecessary.\r\n\r\nIn addition to a primary code, **alternative codes** from other coding systems can also be entered (so that the GPK can be sent along in the event that the patient was registered based on PRK, for example).\r\n\r\nEntering multiple ingredients will enable you to display a compound product. If one of the composite parts is liquid, the dosage will be given in milliliters; otherwise it will be given in ‘units’.\r\n\r\nIn that case, the **composition of the medication** can be specified implicitly (with the use of a medication code) or explicitly, for example by listing the (active) ingredient(s) of the medication.\r\n\r\n**Magistral prescriptions** can be entered as well. This can be done by means of the option listed above to enter coded ingredients and/or by entering the composition and preparation method as free text.\r\nThis is a partial information model.",

The GPK defines the pharmaceutical characteristics of a product: ingredients, strengths, units, pharmaceutical form and route of administration. The Substance Name Code (SNK) is the (active) compound. Further information about the G-Standaard levels see https://www.z-index.nl So called 90.000.000 numbers are used in local IT systems.
